Describing the achievable Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) for this Multi-AZ, 
multi-region database in terms of:

1.1 Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage
1.2 Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage

2.1 Minimum RTO for a single region outage
2.2 Minimum RPO for a single region outage


0. For RTO and RPO for single AZ outage in case of single-AZ deployment (not directly asked for but as baseline):

  - RTO for recovery with an RDS Single-AZ instance failure can vary from minutes to hours. 
    The duration depends on the size of the database and the failure and recovery approach required.

  - RPO (the targeted amount of time during which data is at risk for loss in the event of a failure) for 
    recovery with an RDS Single-AZ instance failure is typically 5 minutes (the interval required for 
    copying transaction logs to Amazon S3), but it can vary. With Single-AZ the only live copy of your data is 
    the EBS volume that holds the data for the instance. While EBS uses mirroring of data under the covers to 
    provide durability and availability, there are several scenarios where you would have no choice other than 
    to recover from backups. In this case you might want to apply the 5 minute log backup interval as your RPO.


1. For RTO and RPO for single AZ outage in case of multi-AZ deployment.

  - Multi-AZ is expected as having the targeted amount of time for a recovery to complete in the event of 
    failure (RTO) of 1-2 minutes and an RPO of 0, since they lose no data on any common failure. 
    Again putting this into more traditional terms, even if a natural disaster were to destroy the data center housing 
    the primary, the secondary would take over with no data loss. So assuming an RPO of 0 makes sense.

  - With Multi-AZ the odds of data loss go way down because you have a separate synchronous copy of the volume 
    being maintained in a separate data center (AZ). If your primary instance fails, you failover to the secondary 
    instance with no data loss. There are far fewer scenarios where recreating the database from backup would be 
    required, but there are still a few. Since volume-level replication is used, a corruption on the primary's 
    volume may be replicated to the secondary's volume. And as rare as this scenario is, it would necessitate 
    recovery from backups. I believe most customers think of Multi-AZ as having an RTO of 1-2 minutes and an RPO 
    of 0, since they lose no data on any common failure. 


2. For RTO and RPO for single region failure in multi-region deployment: 

  - In general a read replica in a different AWS Region will improve the disaster recovery capabilities.
  - If one region fails, we have to promote the read replica to take place of master database. This requires 
    manual intervention. As automated backups are limited to a single AWS Region while manual snapshots 
    and Read Replicas are supported across multiple Regions.
  - There exists asynchronous replication in the case of multi-region deployment. So in the case of a single region 
    failure, RTO and RPO are slightly greater.
  - When you perform a cross-Region restore of a DB snapshot, first you copy the snapshot to the desired Region. 
    Then, you can restore the DB snapshot to a new DB instance.
  - In fact to cover this scenario the use of a cross-Region Read Replica can help ensure that you get back up 
    and running if you experience a regional availability issue, as read replicas can be created in a different Region 
    than the source database.
  - Here the read replica lag is an important factor, which is the time the replica is behind the source database. And
    this impact the recovery and the RTO and RPO values. If the amount of data being replicated is high then this will
    be impacted by the network latency.
  - Because Read Replicas have a running DB instance, the time required to recover after a disaster (RTO) is lower. 
    However, using Read Replicas in this way is generally a more expensive option than using automated backups or database snapshots.
