Describing the achievable Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) for this Multi-AZ, 
multi-region database in terms of:

- Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage
- Minimum RTO for a single region outage
- Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage
- Minimum RPO for a single region outage


RTO for recovery with an RDS Single-AZ instance failure can vary from minutes to hours. 
The duration depends on the size of the database and the failure and recovery approach required.


RPO for recovery with an RDS Single-AZ instance failure is typically 5 minutes (the interval required for 
copying transaction logs to Amazon S3), but it can vary. You can confirm this by calling 
RDS:describe-db-instances:LatestRestorableTime. This service returns the latest time to which a database 
can be restored with point-in-time restore.

With Single-AZ the only live copy of your data is the EBS volume that holds the data for the instance. 
While EBS uses mirroring of data under the covers to provide durability and availability, there are several 
scenarios where you would have no choice other than to recover from backups. In this case you might want to 
apply the 5 minute log backup interval as your RPO.

The RDS Multi-AZ configuration is the recommended approach for production environments due to its ability to 
support low RTO (recovery time objective) and RPO (recovery point objective) requirements. RTO is the targeted 
amount of time for a recovery to complete in the event of failure. RPO is the targeted amount of time during 
which data is at risk for loss in the event of a failure.

Multi-AZ is expected as having an RTO of 1-2 minutes and an RPO of 0, since they lose no data on any common failure. 
Again putting this into more traditional terms, even if a natural disaster were to destroy the data center housing 
the primary, the secondary would take over with no data loss. So assuming an RPO of 0 makes sense.

With Multi-AZ the odds of data loss go way down because you have a separate synchronous copy of the volume 
being maintained in a separate data center (AZ). If your primary instance fails, you failover to the secondary 
instance with no data loss. There are far fewer scenarios where recreating the database from backup would be 
required, but there are still a few. Since volume-level replication is used, a corruption on the primary's 
volume may be replicated to the secondary's volume. And as rare as this scenario is, it would necessitate 
recovery from backups. I believe most customers think of Multi-AZ as having an RTO of 1-2 minutes and an RPO 
of 0, since they lose no data on any common failure.
